NOTES:
- Flask supports cookies using its own built-in mechanism
- Users remain logged in until they log out by clicking the logout button
- Usernames are stored through sessions. Once users login, the usernames are added to a dictionary, and as soon as they press logout, those usernames are removed from the same dictionary using the pop() method.
