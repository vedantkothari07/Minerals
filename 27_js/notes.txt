K27 - Basic functions in JavaScript
2025-01-06m

DISCO:
- JS and Scheme do the same functions except with slightly different syntax
- Scheme used 'cond' for conditionals, while JS used 'if-else'

QCC:
- Out of JS and Scheme, which one is more efficient in terms of carrying out the functions?
- Out of JS and Scheme, which one is more popular amongst devos?

Notes:
- You can copy past the test calls from the file directly into the console if you want additional verification.
