I notice that when you load the root directory (@app.route("/")), you get a page where the text is "No hablo queso!" When you load the site with route (@app.route("/static/foo.html")), you get a site which produced a random number every time you reload the page. However, if you don't add /static/foo.html in your url, the site doesn't load. Lastly, when you load fixie.html, which has route @app.route("/static/fixie.html"), you get a page which shows our team name, K^3, along with all of our names.
