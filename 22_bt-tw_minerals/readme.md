 Time Spent: 1


DISCO: 
- I feel like from the on-ramps I saw, Bootstrap is also very powerful because it has the ability to make things presentable on a website in a manner which is not presentable using normal CSS. It is similar to Foundation in many ways.

QCC: 
- Out of Bootstrap, Tailwind, and Foundation, which of these FEFs is most commonly used today?

q0: Did you have to consult resources beyond your Devo-generated on-ramp? Your answer should be a single binary digit.
- 0

q0b: If answer to preceding question is 1, cite all resources consulted -- including verbal consultations and/or neighbouring team's readme. 1citation/line.

q1: At this point, which FEF do you prefer, and why? Your answer to this Q should be the only portion of your submission that differs from that of your teammate.
- I prefer either Bootstrap or Foundation because as I said earlier, the two seem very similar in many ways, but Tailwind did not. This includes their implementation, funcionality, etc.
