2024-03-12
Time Spent: 2

DISCO:
- Works better as VSCode extension vs on GitHub
- Works better with some sample code in place to use as base
- No buttons to copy chat logs
- AI likes splitting everything into different files, even if it dosen't make the most sense
- Good at revising small amounts of code at a time (1-6 lines)
- More specific prompts lead to better results

Q/C/C:
some areas of interest...
q0: How many tries did it take to "get it right?"
- 2 tries (1 codebase wipe)

q1: Did you catch any errors? If so, how did you notice, and what did you do?
- Errors in what I wanted, fixed by asking it to do the task again

q2: How similar or different is the bot's output to that of your past self / old team?
- Some files were similar, but it split up code (Flask vs database vs init) in different ways (more file structured differently)
- Used more Jinja inheritance (extends base in HTML files)
